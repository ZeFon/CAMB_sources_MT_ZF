# CAMB_sources_MT

This is a modification to [CAMB_sources](https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB/tree/CAMB_sources) that allows for:
- multiple window functions;
- multiple redshift distribution of sources;
- multiple tracers;
- the calculation isolated term correlations;
- calculation of analytical derivatives with respect to clustering bias, fNL, GR corrections, gamma, ns, alpha_s;
- computes the evolution bias for a HI and and H alpha IM experiments given the temperature of HI.
